        This parameter defines the maximum allowed difference between actual PV power

        inefficiencies or inverter standby consumption, and to avoid false positives in
        PV production detection.

        Recommended setting:
        Set this value to approximately twice the typical difference observed when the
        battery is full and PV production slightly exceeds the load.
        Typical values: 100 to 400 W

        Example:
        If your system load is 500 W and PV shows 600 W when the battery is full, the
